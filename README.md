# PPTQ Grinder

This page can be found at [https://josephl.github.io/pptq-grinder](). Its purpose is to make it easier to search for Magic: the Gathering Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier tournaments based on location, date, and format of the tournament.

The [Official PPTQ events page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/pptqmil15/locations) is lacking in any method of visualizing locations or sorting and filtering by criteria. To help with this, I compiled the information in the table and attempted to locate venues using the Google Maps and Places APIs. I was able to plot most of them, and provide an interface to filter based on tournament format and tournament date.

PPTQs that weren't found on Google Maps API are listed on the table below the map.

This page makes use of Open Source software such as jQuery, Bootstrap, Moment.js, and Underscore.js.
